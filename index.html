                <p>The Skywalker lightsaber, also known at various times as Anakin's, Luke's, and Rey's lightsaber, was a blue-bladed Jedi lightsaber constructed by Anakin Skywalker. It remained in Rey's possession until her arrival on Exegol, where she relinquished it to a redeemed Ben Solo, placing the legendary blade back in the hands of a Skywalker. In the aftermath of the Battle of Exegol, Rey buried the famed lightsaber alongside Leia Organa's saber, on Tatooine, the desert homeworld of Anakin and Luke. </p>

                <p>Darth Vader's lightsaber was the personal lightsaber of Darth Vader, a Sith Lord who served as Darth Sidious' last apprentice and supreme military commander of the Galactic Empire. The lightsaber would later be used to destroy Obi-Wan Kenobi and cut off the right hand of his son, Luke Skywalker. During their confrontation on the second Death Star, Luke returned the favor, cutting off the right hand of Darth Vader. Vader's saber clutched in the severed hand, then fell into the reactor shaft of the Death Star II.</p>

                <p>The Darksaber was an ancient and unique black-bladed lightsaber created by Tarre Vizsla, the first Mandalorian ever inducted into the Jedi Order, during the Old Republic. The weapon was kept in the Jedi Temple after Vizsla's passing, but members of House Vizsla stole the saber. Then Darksaber belonged to Pre Vizsla, Darth Maul, Sabine Wren, Bo-Katan. After the Great Purge, Bo-Katan lost possession of the Darksaber. 9 years after the battle of Yavin, the weapon had fallen into the hands of Moff Gideon, the leader of an Imperial remnant on the planet of Nevarro. During his rescue of Grogu from Gideon, the Mandalorian Din Djarin won the Darksaber from Gideon in combat.</p>

                <p>Yoda's lightsaber was the personal lightsaber of Yoda, the last Grand Master of the Jedi High Council. In keeping with its owner's stature, the green-bladed weapon had a shorter hilt and shorter blade. The lightsaber was put to good use on Geonosis when Yoda was forced to confront his former apprentice Darth Tyranus while the first battle of the Clone Wars was being fought outside. Yoda eventually lost his weapon when he dueled the Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Sidious in the Senate Building.</p>

                <p>Ahsoka Tano used two white lightsabers, which had white blades and curved hilts, replaced the lightsabers she used before leaving the Jedi Order during the Clone Wars, which Tano had abandoned to fake her death to the Galactic Empire after the Siege of Mandalore. Tano obtained the kyber crystals used in these lightsabers one year after the end of the Clone Wars, retrieving them from the lightsaber of the Sixth Brother, an Inquisitor she had killed. Though the crystals originally emitted a red blade, she purified them with the Force.</p>

                <p>The Skywalker lightsaber, also known at various times as Anakin's, Luke's, and Rey's lightsaber, was a blue-bladed Jedi lightsaber constructed by Anakin Skywalker. It remained in Rey's possession until her arrival on Exegol, where she relinquished it to a redeemed Ben Solo, placing the legendary blade back in the hands of a Skywalker. In the aftermath of the Battle of Exegol, Rey buried the famed lightsaber alongside Leia Organa's saber, on Tatooine, the desert homeworld of Anakin and Luke. </p>

It was modeled on the third lightsaber of Jedi MasterObi-Wan Kenobi, though its kyber crystal emitted a green plasma blade. Skywalker constructed his own lightsaber after losing his father's in a duel with the Sith Lord Darth Vader. He used it to kill Jabba's bodyguards while rescuing Han Solo on Tatooine. In the Battle of Endor, Vader lost his lightsaber as a result of his defeat by Skywalker during their final lightsaber duel.</p>

               <p>Rey's lightsaber was a yellow-bladed lightsaber that was constructed as a personal weapon by the Jedi Rey Skywalker during the First Order/Resistance War. It was built of salvaged materials from the maker's quarterstaff and a cloth handgrip. Like the quarterstaff, it originated as Rey's lightsaber hilt was blocky and heavy due to its exterior armor that made it resistant to impact and wear and tear. The weapon had a kyber crystal at its heart and emitted a yellow-colored plasma blade when ignited.</p>

                <p>Darth Vader's lightsaber was the personal lightsaber of Darth Vader, a Sith Lord who served as Darth Sidious' last apprentice and supreme military commander of the Galactic Empire. The lightsaber would later be used to destroy Obi-Wan Kenobi and cut off the right hand of his son, Luke Skywalker. During their confrontation on the second Death Star, Luke returned the favor, cutting off the right hand of Darth Vader. Vader's saber clutched in the severed hand, then fell into the reactor shaft of the Death Star II.</p>

                <p>The Darksaber was an ancient and unique black-bladed lightsaber created by Tarre Vizsla, the first Mandalorian ever inducted into the Jedi Order, during the Old Republic. The weapon was kept in the Jedi Temple after Vizsla's passing, but members of House Vizsla stole the saber. Then Darksaber belonged to Pre Vizsla, Darth Maul, Sabine Wren, Bo-Katan. After the Great Purge, Bo-Katan lost possession of the Darksaber. 9 years after the battle of Yavin, the weapon had fallen into the hands of Moff Gideon, the leader of an Imperial remnant on the planet of Nevarro. During his rescue of Grogu from Gideon, the Mandalorian Din Djarin won the Darksaber from Gideon in combat.</p>

                <p>Kylo Ren's lightsaber was previously Ben Solo's lightsaber, constructed by Ren in his life as Ben Solo while training as a Jedi Padawan under his uncle, the Jedi Master Luke Skywalker. Originally the weapon had a blue blade, but after he fell to the dark side, Ren modified it into one with a red blade. The modified lightsaber incorporated a crossguard hilt, requiring it to have lateral vents on either side of the handle to divert the extra heat generated by the crystal. After Ren faced Rey on the remains of the second Death Star, he saw a vision of his late father, who showed his son that he loved him. Ren ultimately cast his Sith lightsaber into the ocean and, in doing so, became Ben Solo once more.</p>

In keeping with its owner's stature, the green-bladed weapon had a shorter hilt and shorter blade.

Yoda eventually lost his weapon when he dueled the Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Sidious in the Senate Building.</p>
